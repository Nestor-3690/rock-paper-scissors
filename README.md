# rock-paper-scissors

### Description

The goal of this project is to create a "rock, paper, scissors" game using JavaScript.

This project has one html page (index.html) that contains the script tag for the JavaScript file (script.js) and the buttons and divs for the game.

Each time the user click either on "rock", "paper" or "scissors", a round is played between him and the computer. The winner of the round take one point.
When either the user or the computer has 5 points, the game is stopped and the final score is printed.
